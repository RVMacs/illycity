                    <h4>Ill City Clothing was established in 2014 with the aim to promote our hometown, Iloilo City, through
                        urban street fashion. Iloilo is the city of love and we wanted to provide Ilonggos with a medium for 
                        displaying their love for the city. Our designs showcase some of the city’s historic monuments that
                        symbolize how significant our South Town is. Ill City Clothing is jam packed with meaning, not just style.
                         </h4>
                         
                    <h4>We want to encourage our generation to be genuinely proud of your hometown, your roots. Revive
                        that old school patriotism through new school urban street style. No matter where you are in the world,
                        carry your culture and your hometown with you.</h4>

                    <h4>Ill City isn’t your ordinary retail fashion hub. We’ve got big dreams and Ill City Clothing is going places.
                        Ultimately, we want to make every city an Ill City. And eventually maybe even world domination! But
                        we’ll keep our dreams in check for now and focus on bringing you something to be proud about.
                        Represent your Ill City, be united by the place you call home. </h4>
